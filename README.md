# U-QoIT
- This is a java applet simulator. It can generate a mobile ad hoc network with any number of static or mobile nodes. The nodes can be of three types namely: i) source node, ii) relay node, and iii) query node. The data travels from source to query node and may consist of any number of data packets. The simulator has ability to simulate simplistic form of dynamic bush-fire scenario [1] and establishes path between end nodes with QoIT [2] method. To inter-connect network that is partitioned by node mobility or bush-fire, the simulator is able to deploy a set of UAVs. The UAV placement startegy is called U-QoIT and is represented in our latest work [3].
- The simulator can be run using JDK 1.8 and any java editor such as Eclipse or NetBeans.
- The main file is "dtnrouting.java". You can modify any part of the simulator according to your needs.
